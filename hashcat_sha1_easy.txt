Failed to initialize NVIDIA RTC library.

* Device #1: CUDA SDK Toolkit not installed or incorrectly installed.
             CUDA SDK Toolkit required for proper device support and utilization.
             For more information, see: https://hashcat.net/faq/wrongdriver
             Falling back to OpenCL runtime.

If you are using WSL2 you can use CUDA instead of OpenCL.
Users must not install any NVIDIA GPU Linux driver within WSL 2
For all details: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html

TLDR; go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads and follow this path:
  Linux -> Architecture -> Distribution -> Version -> deb (local)
Follow the installation Instructions on the website.

ATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) backend kernels selected.
Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.
See the above message to find out about the exact limits.

The wordlist or mask that you are using is too small.
This means that hashcat cannot use the full parallel power of your device(s).
Hashcat is expecting at least 933888 base words but only got 1.1% of that.
Unless you supply more work, your cracking speed will drop.
For tips on supplying more work, see: https://hashcat.net/faq/morework
